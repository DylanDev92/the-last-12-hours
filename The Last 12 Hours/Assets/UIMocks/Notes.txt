Mocks for requested and required screens:
"Tasks for Minh:
Inventory UI.
Menu UI.
Main menu UI."
Additional needed UI was "Game Over" per Assignment specifications.

Feel free to give feedback on potential changes.

Proper UI/Scenes can be made after everyone agrees to the UI mock.

There was an attempt to keep a rather simple UI, mainly using white/black with the exception of logos.
